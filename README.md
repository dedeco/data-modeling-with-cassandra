# Datasets

For this project, you'll be working with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:

```
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
```

# Modeling NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database

 - Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
 - Test your model

# ETL Pipeline

    - Iterate through each event file in event_data to process and create a new CSV file in Python
    - Load processed records into relevant tables in your data model
    - Test your queries
